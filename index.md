  <i>What are <font color="red">"They"</font> doing with
     <font color="red">our data</font>?</i>

The Web can be a black box. When a user sees an ad about spiritual
meditation methods, she may not realize that she's seeing that ad
because she recently received an email about depression or cancer.
We are seeking to change that, and in doing so bring more transparency
to the Web.

For this, we developed XRay, a new tool that reveals which
data in a web account, such as emails, searches, or viewed products,
are being used to target which outputs, such as ads, recommended
products, or prices.  It can increase end-user awareness about
what the services they use do with their data, and it can enable auditors
and watchdogs with the necessary tools to keep the Web in check.

Currently, XRay can reveal some forms of targeting for Gmail ads,
Amazon product recommendations, and YouTube video recommendations.
However, XRay's core mechanisms are largely service-agnostic, providing
the necessary building blocks that we hope will enable a new generation
of auditing tools that will help lift the curtain on how users' personal
data is being used.

Using our XRay Gmail prototype, we found some pretty interesting
examples of data uses, such as a number of ads targeting depression,
cancer, and other illnesses.  We also saw quite a few subprime loan ads
for used cars that targeted debt, loan, or borrow keywords in users'
inboxes.

<!--
Privacy has all but disappeared in today's data-driven world.
This is due to users who are often too eager to share their data online
and Web services that are too eager to collect and use their information.
Our approach is to <font color="blue"><b>increase transparency</b></font>
of what Web services do with users' data -- what data they collect, for what
purposes they are using it, and with whom they share it -- thereby empowering
users, and auditors on their behalf, to reach informed conclusions about
the services they use.  We are releasing <font color="blue"><b>XRay</b></font>,
a first tool that reveals how Web services use our data (such as emails or
searches) to target various outputs (such as ads or recommendations).
