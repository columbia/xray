### Toward a Transparent Web

The recent NSA leaks by Snowden brought forth to the public's attention the
massive data collection practiced by the government XXX.  They opened a
public debate about the implications of this data collection and unsupervised
use.  Its potential uses XXX.  However, it's not only the NSA that is collecting
personal data and using it for a wide variety of purposes.  Many private
companies are now doing the exact same thing.  They get the data through
mobile apps that follow users' every location, search, or visited website;
.





Today's Web services accumulate enormous
sensitive information -- such as emails, search logs, or locations -- and use
them to target advertisements, prices, or products at users. Presently, users
have little insight into how their data is used for such purposes. To enhance
transparency, we are building XRay, a generic system that predicts what data --
such as emails or searches -- is used to target which ads in Gmail, which prices
in Amazon, etc.  The insight is to compare ads/prices witnessed by different
accounts with similar, but not identical, subsets of the data.
