### A Potential Attack

Our realization that it is possible to target ads against what sensitive topics,
including various diseases, sexual orientation, personal financial situation, etc.,
made us think about a particular attack.  Imagine an insurance company wanted to
gain insight into pre-existing conditions of its customers before signing them up.
It could create two ad campaigns -- one that targets cancer and another youth -- and
assign different URLs to each campaign.  It could then offer higher premium quotes to
visitors who come through the cancer-related ads to discourage them from signing up
while offering lower premium quotes to those who come through youth-related ads.
We believe that the potential for this attack illustrates the urgent need for increased
transparency in ad targeting.

To verify that this attack is possible, we implemented an innocuous version of it.
We created some ad campaigns, each targeted against various sensitive topics, including
cancer, XXX, and XXX.  Our ads clearly stated their research-related purpose and
the fact that clicking on them would leak out potentially sensitive information about them
to us.  Upon clicking on an ad, the user would be redirected to a page that revealed to
them what we knew about them from just this click.  We then asked them to fill in a form
to relate their level of surprise at realizing what we knew about them.  We retained no
personally identifiable information (e.g., IP, location, cookies, etc.) associated with
the responses.

The table below shows our impressions, clicks, and form fill-ins for each
ad campaign, along with a few example .  XXX (1) It is possible to customize
the service to the campaign.  (2) It would be trivial to collect this
information using PII .  (3) Users are extremely surprised at realizing that they
are being targeted with various emails. XXX
