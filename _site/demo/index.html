<h3 id="use-case:-revealing-gmail-ad-targeting">Use Case:  Revealing Gmail Ad Targeting</h3>

<p>As a show-case experiment, we created an XRay demo service that
continuously collects and diagnoses Gmail ads related to a particular
set of topics, including various diseases, pregnancy, race, sexual
orientation, divorce, debt, etc.  We&#39;ve found some interesting
associations: a <font color="red">&quot;Shamanic healing&quot;</font> ad appeared
exclusively in accounts containing emails about <font color="red">depression</font>;
a number of <font color="green">clothing brand ads</font> correlate strongly
with the presence of <font color="green">pregnancy-related emails</font>
in a user&#39;s inbox; and <font color="magenta">used car ads</font> correlate
strongly with <font color="magenta">debt-related emails</font>, suggesting
subprime targeting.</p>

<p>Below we discuss a few example findings, which illustrate XRay&#39;s potential.
If you&#39;re interested in our latest data, please visit our
<a href="http://data.lec.io/"><font color="blue"><b>live XRay ad
service</b></font></a>, which is continuously collecting ads targeted on a
number of topics.</p>

<h3 id="example-findings">Example Findings</h3>

<p>We created emails focused on topics such as cancer, Alzheimer&#39;s, depression,
race, homosexuality, pregnancy, divorce, and debt.  Each email consisted
of keywords closely related to one topic (e.g., the depression-related email
included <i>depression</i>, <i>depressed</i>, and <i>sad</i>; the pregnancy
email included <i>pregnancy</i> and <i>pregnant</i>).
We then launched XRay to collect and diagnose ads shown for these emails.</p>

<p>The table below shows sample ads that XRay associated with each topic.
Conservatively, we only show here ads where XRay computed very high confidence
scores. Under the table, we discuss four observations from this data. Our
<a href="http://data.lec.io/"><font color="blue"><b>XRay ad service</b></font></a>
contains more data, along with associated confidence levels.
Note that all findings we describe are results from correlation analyses
and do not imply causality.</p>

<h3 id="example-insights">Example Insights</h3>

<p>While larger-scale experience with more topics is needed to reach statistically
meaningful, quantitative conclusions, we next formulate four high-level observations:</p>

<ol>
<li><p><font color="red"><b>It is possible to target sensitive topics in users&#39;
inboxes:</b></font>
Many of our disease-related emails are strongly correlated with
a number of ads.  A &quot;Shamanic healing&quot; ad appears exclusively in accounts
containing the depression-related email, and many times in its context; ads for
assisted living services target the Alzheimer email; and a Ford campaign to
fight breast cancer targets the cancer email.
Race, homosexuality, pregnancy, divorce, and debt also attract plenty of ads.</p></li>
<li><p><font color="red"><b>Targeting is often obscure and potentially dangerous:</b></font>
For many of the ads in the table, the association with the targeted email
is not obvious at all and would likely be indiscernable to the users.
Nothing in the &quot;Shamanic healing&quot; ad suggests targeting against depression;
nothing in the general-purpose clothing ads suggest targeting against pregnancy;
and nothing in the &quot;Cedars hotel&quot; ad suggests an orientation toward the
homosexuality email.  This obscurity, coupled with the ability to target very
sensitive aspects, opens users to subtle dangers and show-cases an urgent need
for increased transparency in ad targeting.  If no keyword in the ad suggests
relation with sensitive topics, a user clicking on the ad may not realize that
they could be disclosing private information to advertisers.</p></li>
<li><p><font color="red"><b>Targeting sometimes misses the point:</b></font>
One might think that ad targeting is always precise and sophisticated.  However,
we found quite a few cases where targeting seemed to be done through very basic
keyword matching and completely missed the semantic meaning of the email.
For example, an email about divorce, which happened to contain the keyword &quot;marriage&quot;
in its body (in the format &quot;end of marriage&quot;), attracted not only divorce-related ads,
but also several ads related to wedding planning and invitations.  As another example,
an email about TV shows was targeted by ads related to various brands of watches just
because it contained the word &quot;watch&quot; (as in &quot;watch TV&quot;) in its body. We wonder, then,
whether those were the placements intended by the advertisers, or whether they are
examples of ineffective advertising.  Regardless, this finding suggests that increased
transparency may be valuable not just for users, but also for advertisers.</p></li>
<li><p><font color="red"><b>XRay has surprisingly broad applicability:</b></font>
Looking at the ad data, we realized that XRay&#39;s potential is even greater
than providing transparency to end users.  Using it, we found a pretty interesting
form of targeting: <em>subprime targeting</em>.  According to a
<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/19/in-a-subprime-bubble-for-used-cars-unfit-borrowers-pay-sky-high-rates/">recent NYT article</a>, our society is undergoing a new subprime loan bubble, this
time for used cars.  We were able to witness a projection of this
trend in the ads we collected.  We saw a significant number of car loan
ads that promised 100% acceptance without credit score or backing, and
which targeted specifically keywords such as <em>loan</em>, <em>borrow</em>, or <em>debt</em>.
We also saw a car dealership ad that enticed users to take a Toyota test drive
for a $50 gift card; that ad was targeting the <em>debt</em> keyword.  This suggests
that lenders don&#39;t just advertise the availability of easy loans to the general
public, they explicitly try to target population that lacks credit solvence.</p></li>
</ol>

<!-- We've also seen a car dealership ad correlated strongly with the *debt*
keyword; it enticed the targeted users to take a Toyota test drive by
offering a $50 gift. -->

<!--These examples made us reflect on a new use for XRay: if
advertising is an integral part of our society, our hypothesis is that
revealing ad targeting might enable new, interesting ways to quantify trends
within the society (e.g., economic trends, political campaigns, etc.).
We leave investigation of this hypothesis for future work.-->

<!--Inspired by these ads, we developed an
[attack](#attack) that illustrates the dangers of obscure targeting.-->

<!-- 
Finally, lots of ads about stock investments were targeted against an email about debt
and personal bankruptcy.  Incidentally, searching for "end of marriage" in Google
yields only divorce-related results, suggesting that search may be more semantic
than ad targeting in this particular case.
Regardless, this finding suggests that increased transparency may be valuable
not just for users, but also for advertisers, who may wish to know how their ads
are actually being placed.
-->

<!--
<h3 id="attack"> A Potential Attack </h3>

Our realization that it is possible to target ads against sensitive topics,
including various diseases, sexual orientation, personal financial situation, etc.,
made us think about a particular attack.  Imagine an insurance company wanted to
gain insight into pre-existing conditions of its customers before signing them up.
It could create two ad campaigns -- one that targets cancer and another youth -- and
assign different URLs to each campaign.  It could then offer higher premium quotes to
visitors who come through the cancer-related ads to discourage them from signing up
while offering lower premium quotes to those who come through youth-related ads.
We believe that the potential for this attack illustrates the urgent need for increased
transparency in ad targeting.
-->

<!--
To verify that this attack is possible, we implemented an innocuous version of it.
We created some ad campaigns, each targeted against various sensitive topics, including
cancer, depression, pregnancy, sexuality, race, etc.  Our ads clearly stated their
research-related purpose and the fact that clicking on them would leak out potentially
sensitive information about them to us.  Upon clicking on an ad, the user would be
redirected to a page that revealed to them what we knew about them from just this click.
We then asked them to fill in a form to relate their level of surprise at realizing what
we knew about them.  We retained no personally identifiable information (e.g., IP,
location, cookies, etc.) associated with the responses. -->

<!--
The table below shows our impressions, clicks, and form fill-ins for each
ad campaign, along with a few example .  XXX (1) It is possible to customize
the service to the campaign.  (2) It would be trivial to collect this
information using PII .  (3) Users are extremely surprised at realizing that they
are being targeted with various emails. XXX

<h3 id="interested-in-ad-targeting?-what-you-can-do">Interested in Ad Targeting?  What You Can Do</h3>

<p>The above findings are examples of observations one can make using XRay.
They come from our limited and somewhat ad-hoc experience using XRay to reverse ad
targeting in Gmail for a few specific topics that we thought were interesting.  Over the
next period, we plan to run larger scale experiments to quantify some of our
example-driven observations from above.</p>

<p>There are undoubtedly many more other things to try using our <a href="http://data.lec.io/">
<font color="blue">XRay ad service</font></a>
(e.g., topics on which to collect ads, observations to make from our existing data).
If you have an idea for a topic that would be interesting to track ad targeting for,
please <a href="/xray/team/">send us an email</a>.  We&#39;ll try to incorporate your
topic of interest into our <a href="http://data.lec.io/">
<font color="blue">XRay ad service</font></a> and make the ads targeting that topic
available to you.  Due to the volume of emails we receive, we may not be able to
respond directly to all requests.</p>

<p>XRay as a framework is very general and can track use of data for targeting well
beyond ads.  Read about other potential use cases in our
<a href="/xray/public/xray.pdf">research paper</a> and feel free to use our
<a href="https://github.com/MatLecu/xray">source code</a> to investigate your own ideas.
Time permitting, we&#39;d be happy to help with any customization you may need to do.</p>
