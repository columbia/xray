### XRay: Increasing the Web's Transparency

Today's Web services accumulate enormous
sensitive information -- such as emails, search logs, or locations -- and use
them to target advertisements, prices, or products at users. Presently, users
have little insight into how their data is used for such purposes. To enhance
transparency, we are building XRay, a generic system that predicts what data --
such as emails or searches -- is used to target which ads in Gmail, which prices
in Amazon, etc.
The insight is to compare ads/prices witnessed by different accounts with
similar, but not identical, subsets of the data.
